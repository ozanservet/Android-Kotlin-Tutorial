4- Drawing App
This is an app that allows kids to draw some images with different colors and brush size. They can also add a picture and draw on it. User can save images to phone or share with their friends.

5- 7 Minute Workout App
This app includes several exercises (30 seconds for each) with 10 second breaks. Text to speech asistant of android aids to translate words to sounds. RecyclerView used to design better UI. The history of workouts stored using SQLite. BMI (Body Mass index) calculator is another functionality for both metric and us units.

6- Happy Places App
You can save the location, a picture from camera or gallery and more to store a place. In the main page, there were places listed by the user. However, Google Places API is deactive because it needs payment and special SHA code which might cause security vulnerability if I add here. For these reasons, I deleted my SHA code and commented small piece of code but you can receive current location and translate it to readable address now.
Furthermore, I used the third party library Dexter (to receive permissions easier), rounded image feature with third party library (hdohedhof ), gallery, camera and GPS permissions, google places API/google maps (deactive in code but you can add by payment or free limited version), SQLite local database and RecyclerView many more.
